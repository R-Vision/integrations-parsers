 Так как протокол HTTP не обеспечивает шифрование данных, злоумышленник, прослушивающий HTTP-сессию, сможет получить всю информацию и все учетные данные аутентификации, передаваемые в рамках данной сессии. После этого злоумышленник может попытаться получить доступ к устройству с помощью перехваченных данных аутентификации. В случае успеха атакующий получит доступ к системе в контексте пользователя, чьи учетные данные были использованы. Поскольку протокол HTTP часто применяется для управления сетевыми устройствами, подобная атака может позволить злоумышленнику получить права доступа администратора.",
